“A rogue who’s daggers are named after insults.”

Seabright Weathers

“Throwing insults”

# Character:

Chaotic Neutral. He values his own freedom and self-interests above all else, but doesn't necessarily have a malicious or malevolent intent towards others. He is willing to help others if it suits his own purposes or if he feels it is necessary for his survival, but he is also prone to taking risks and pursuing his own agenda regardless of any potential consequences.

This character is a skilled and sly rogue who enjoys using their sharp wit as much as their sharp blades. Each of their daggers is named after an insult, which they use to add insult to injury when taking down their enemies. For example, they might use the dagger "Twit" to take out a particularly foolish opponent, or "Idiot" to take down a particularly slow or clumsy foe.

The rogue's love of insults extends beyond just their daggers. They are quick with a quip and love to trade verbal jabs with their enemies, often using their sharp tongue to distract and disorient their opponents before striking with their blades. They have a quick wit and a dry sense of humor, which they use to their advantage in both combat and social situations.

Despite their penchant for insults, the rogue is not without their own vulnerabilities. They have a quick temper and can become easily offended by insults directed at them. They are also fiercely protective of their friends and allies, and will not hesitate to defend them with their life if necessary.

Overall, the rogue with insult-named daggers is a unique and memorable character that brings a fun and entertaining element to any adventure.

Based on the backstory provided, this rogue character may have a playful and whimsical personality with a tendency towards mischief and humor. As a former jester, they may enjoy entertaining others with jokes and tricks, but also have a tendency towards cynicism and dark humor. Their time as a sailor may have instilled a sense of adventure and wanderlust, making them restless and always seeking new experiences. They may have a tendency to act impulsively and take risks, which could sometimes get them into trouble. However, their quick wit and charm can often get them out of sticky situations. Overall, this rogue character is likely to be charismatic, adventurous, and a bit unpredictable.

# Backstory:

Our rogue with the insult-named daggers was born into a life of entertainment. He grew up in France during the reign of King Louis XVI and was trained as a court jester. He was born with a sharp wit and a talent for acrobatics, which made him a natural entertainer. He quickly became a favorite of the royal court and was invited to perform for the king himself.

However, as the French Revolution began to stir, our jester became uneasy. He saw the growing unrest among the people and knew that his life as a court entertainer was in jeopardy. With the help of some sympathetic servants, he fled the court and made his way to the port city of Marseille.

There, he signed up as a sailor on a merchant ship, hoping to put some distance between himself and the revolution. He quickly adapted to life at sea and proved to be a skilled sailor. He became known among the crew for his quick wit and his ability to entertain during long, boring stretches at sea.

It was during this time that he began to craft his insult-named daggers. He had always been a bit of a prankster, and he found that naming his weapons after insults added to their effectiveness in combat. He became known as a fearsome fighter, always armed with a sharp tongue and even sharper blades.

Years went by, and our rogue sailed to ports all over the world, making a name for himself as a skilled sailor and a deadly fighter. He never forgot his roots as a court jester, and he continued to entertain his shipmates with his antics and his sharp wit. But the memories of his former life haunted him, and he knew that he could never return to France.

So he continued to sail, always moving, always searching for something new. He may have left the court jester behind, but he had found a new identity as a sailor and a rogue, armed with his trusty insult-named daggers and his quick wit.

# Insults

## Daggers:

"Fool": This dagger is sharp and sleek, with a slim blade that allows for swift and precise strikes. The handle is adorned with a jester's cap and bells, a mocking reminder of the dagger's insulting name.

"Worm": This dagger has a slightly curved blade that resembles the wriggling body of a worm. The handle is made of rough wood, and is adorned with small stones that resemble dirt or gravel. The name is meant to belittle an opponent's courage and strength.

"Whiner": This dagger has a jagged blade that seems to wail and moan with every cut. The handle is wrapped in frayed leather, resembling the cords of a whimpering dog's leash. The name is meant to mock an opponent's complaints or excuses.

"Maggot": This dagger has a short, fat blade that resembles the squirming body of a maggot. The handle is adorned with a small, wriggling worm made of wire, reminding the wielder of the disgusting nature of the insult. The name is meant to belittle an opponent's status or worth.

"Rat": This dagger has a sharp, pointed blade that is designed for quick and precise stabs. The handle is adorned with a rat's tail, wrapped tightly around the grip. The name is meant to insult an opponent's cowardice and sneaky behavior.

"Sissy": This dagger has a delicate blade that is meant for precision and accuracy rather than brute force. The handle is adorned with a pink ribbon, adding to the insult of the name. The name is meant to belittle an opponent's strength and courage.

"Coward": This dagger has a jagged, uneven blade that looks almost as if it was crudely sharpened. The handle is adorned with a symbol of a yellow belly, a reference to the insult of being called a coward. The name is meant to mock an opponent's bravery and willingness to fight.

English:

You pretentious, vain imbecile. You're as thin as a sheet of paper, and your arrogance rivals your stupidity. I'm convinced you'd shatter like an eggshell if you were ever faced with a real challenge.

## Sentence:

"Tu es tellement bête que tu ferais honte à un caillou." (You're so stupid that you'd make a rock feel ashamed.)
