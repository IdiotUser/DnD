Sports a large tricorn with accompanying [red feather](<Le Cormoran de Crétine>).
A Van Dyke beard, of which he is quite proud of.
Sailor's slops
Seaman's trousers
tattered blue _casaque_ (cassock).  %%why would a character choose to wear their old uniform, a uniform that stands for the complete opposite of their beliefs, everything that they oppose within their heart?  IDK, Reclaimed iconography? To sullen its reputation? Because deep down he is not sure he made the right choice, that he, in a small way, still wishes to return to a state of innocent naivety about his culture?  Because it looks cool?%%
_Baudrier_ (Baldric) with accompanying double scabbard.
A Frankish denier on a necklace %%For emergency grog, a memento and holdover of his piracy days, of which he is unlikely to spent without due course.%%

**Father** (8 quarterlings) is raised as commoner, gains privileges, doesn't forget past (good), marries artist (commoner), does military service, has son (4 quarterlings), hires teachers for son (prefers combat), teachers dislike commoner mother and turn son against her, son is brat, has son2, raises son better(?), hires new teachers for son2, son2 is less brat, but isn't very smart, still learns, but prefers artist stuff with mother (except politics, enjoys politics), has daughter, daughter is best, becomes widower, enjoys lessons (especially politics, but has opposing opinions to teachers), good at arts, ect.  Happy peasents don't cause unrest.
## Childhood
Born to a minor noble, Oliver de la Fère[^4] 

> [!info]- Musketeer
> As one of the junior units in the Royal Guard, the Musketeers were not closely linked to the royal family. Traditional bodyguard duties were in fact performed by the _[Gardes du Corps](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardes_du_Corps_du_Roi_%28France%29>)_ and the _[Cent-suisses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Guards "Swiss Guards")_. Because of its later establishment, the Musketeers were open to the lower classes of French nobility or younger sons from noble families whose oldest sons served in the more prestigious _Garde du Corps_ and _Chevau-legers_ (Light Horse). The Musketeers, many of them still teenagers, soon gained a reputation for fighting spirit and unruly behaviour. %%[^2]%%
## Adolescence
jeunesse dorée (dandy, literally *"gilded youth"*)

ou

les enfants perdus (Forlorn Hope, literally *"the lost children"*)[^5]
## Revolution
During his revolutionary insurgency, he adopted the *nom de guerre* "Rouget La Marseillaise[^3]", where he learnt the Verlan argot (thieve's cant)

In a sufficiently large city/state/populace (such as _La Valér_, Valonier) might there be enough people of opposing views on the Solarswords to stage a revolt? Perhaps one that succeeds in occupying the population centre for long enough to declare independence as a republic and execute several nobles and aristocrats (including any memebers of the Solarswords foolish enough to walk through town in their livery, or anyone known to associate with them to the perceived detriment of the people), but being quickly vanquished by a legion of Solarswords, leading to increased Solarsword activity in attempts to prevent revolutionary ideas (perhaps leading to further discontent), execution of the ringleaders and imprisonment to anyone who participated in illegal activities, and the fleeing of certain members of said revolt?
>  Well
>  Would you like to call

%%This is too successful, and comes off as a terrorist occupation.  Who supported this revolt?  How is it seen now?%%

## Life Aboard the [Cormorant](Le Cormoran de Crétine)
Facing possible execution for his hand in the failed revolution, Jean-Luc fled about a merchant ship bound for Arakous.  Shortly after getting under way, the ship was attacked by pirates.  Whereby an offer was made.  Jean-Luc could sink with the ship, or join the pirates on the high seas
