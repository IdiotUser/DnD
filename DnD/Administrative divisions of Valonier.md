The Grand Demesnes of Valonier mirror the ancient peerages of the paladins, also called the 12 Peers.  The once great realm of Valonier has since diminished in size and influence.  What remains of the 12 Grand Demesnes is now but one, the Demesne of \[DEMESNE], colloquially 

Each Grand Demesne was under the protection of one of the 12 peers of Valonier (_Pairie de l'Valér_), characterised by their blue bonnets.

comprised of the 12 preeminent vassals of the Realm.
	6 eclesiatical peers
		Archbishop-duke (_Archidiocèse_), premier peer
		2 Bishop-dukes(_Diocèse_)
		3 Bishop-Counts (_Diocèse_)
	6 Lay peers
		3 dukes (_Duc_), 1 premier lay peer
		3 Counts (_comte_)

Each Grande Demesne was designated as either a pairie-duché or pairie-comté for duchies and counties respectively.
