> I am the custodian of the [chronicles of Mwarf](Mwarf's%20Tome.md), first herald of the one true God, [BARrY](BARrY); keeper of the [[shard of the key to his tome]];  last Steward of The [[Order of the Apostle]].
# Equipment
The Chronicler carries a tome bound in the petrified bark of a long extinct tree.  It’s pages appear blank to those unworthy (requires one to interpret the patterns in the grains of the paper: [Druidic](Druid#Druidic) interpretations of the dead trees)

The Chronicler dons a cloak of white rabbit pelts, those of the heathen order Mwarf once belonged to.  ([[Speak with dead]] allows communion with the creatures sacrificed to make the cloak)

The [[shard of the Key to the Tome]] of [BARrY](BARrY) is but a fragment of an [[ancient amulet]] once carried by Mwarf.  It was said to be able to unlock the [Box](Box) that held [[BARrY]] captive.  The location of the other fragments are lift to time.
# Chronicles 
The Chronicles speak of an ancient order of knights, The [[Cult of Alstriza]], whom with one of Mwarf’s First Company belonged to.  The COA are fierce foes and great allies.  The  [[Chroniclers]] still holds vestiges of this ancient alliance.
