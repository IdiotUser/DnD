# Squizards:

Mind Flayer | Squizard | Puppet Master | Dead Dancer | Corpse Keeper | Mind Melter |

![[Attachment.png|400]]

So named for their conical brain sack, reminiscent of a wizard’s pointcap, the squizard…

A squizard feeds off of the knowledge of lesser beings, being able to consume information at a rapid pace, squizards are able to amass vast quantities of thought however require many brains to hold them.

This squizard brain ritual is a sacred and often dangerous tradition for squizards.

_May cause death due to incompatable brain blood type. Exponentially harder as the brains blood types become more and more restrictive._

**Squidling:**

DC10 dex save to avoid falling squid.

DC10 con save to not be controlled, DC10 athletics/acrobatics to remove squidling.

+1 to roll for each tentacle used to hinder. Tentacles subtract from multi attack

Assistance to remove squid provides advantage.

_(roll 1d20 athletics/acrobatics, add roll -10 to victim roll._

Attacking squid deals half damage to the victim.

Multiattack:

Each tentacle deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, DC8 dex check to avoid single limb grapple.

**Alchemist’s Laboratory:**

Set upon the stone slabs - what were once tables for alchemical experimentation - are now bodies. One wears a scholar’s robes, one the armour of a knight. One, the cover of the forests, and one, the uniform of a thief.

_The bodies available to the mind flayer for puppeteering._

Glassware and concoctions lay strewn across the floor. Fuming and fizzing, bubbling and burning.

_Damage when touching. - i.e: knocked prone, 1d4 any damage per round._

# Green Milk

From soy milk

Properties: mild levitation (Amber)

![](_ARCHIVED/Attachments/Attachment.jpeg)

**Milk for where?:**
Cow, oxen, yak?

**Why green?:**
Leaves? Grass juice? Copper? - oxidation

**Harvesting:**
Can’t have fallen from the sky?!?!?
From special cows?

**Why levitate?:**
Space, reaction, ~~magic~~?

**Where cows?:**
Asia (soy), space, underground?
Must be hidden.

**Is it milk?:**
Leaf blended, grass juice, cow poo, cow eyes?

**How power to levitate?:**
Entropy.
Is gas when heated, lighter than air?
Has power?
Milk is like liquid hydrogen. Pasteurisation leads to expansion. 20x lighter than hydrogen, used as lifting gas. Requires heat to stay gaseous.

**Power from?:**
Photosynthesis, closer to sun in space, more power.
Space algae, eaten by aeroxen.

Phlox (Derived - Plogisten, ) Oxide (ox +ide | oxide), “soy” (Asia, archaic) or “green milk” comes from the Aeroxen (aero + oxen | aerwhales, Aether), native to the outer rim’s (exosphere) Aether (minecraft mod, sky). Phloxide has been used as a recreational drug by people of the Asian subcontinent since ancient times, it was not until pasteurisation was introduced during the discovery of Asia by the Europeans that it first found practical use in soy balloons and aero-decks.

**Fallings**

Historically, soy was harvested from the coats of fallen Aeroxen, when their oxide coats would become too heavy for them to support, being unable to navigate the airways and falling through a hole in the ozone, or they would float too low when breaching the ozone (ox + zone | ozone) layer for oxygen. In either case, their bodies would be crushed by the massive pressure of the atmospheres on their fragile bones, and float down towards the surface of the planet.

Aeroxen fallings can appear all over the world, however are most concentrated in the Asian sub continent due to the hole in the ozone layer.

**Aeroxen**
Aeroxen are classified as mixotrophs as the astrophagal algae, phlogiston, they consume can be inferred into their coats, allowing them to photosynthesis as well as consume the algae.

**Controversy**
Since the rise of soy balloons in the 18th decade (GR, since the green revolution), Aeroxen hunting has become more and more prominent. Flotsam (balloon operators) are altering their balloons to fly higher and higher, into Aeroxen grazing grounds and shooting them with heavy harpoons, fired from spring guns, in an attempt to weigh them down and harvest their valuable coats. Many shots are required to bring down most adult Aeroxen, however hunters usually only get a handful of opportunities to shoot an ox before spooking the herd. This results in crippled oxen with harpoons stick in them, or hunters going for stot (a young ox).

Cases of Flotsam flying too high without oxygen equipment or layden with too many heavy harpoons have resulted in approximately 138 deaths.

**Astrophagal**: space algae
**Flotsam**: A balloon operator
**Floatilla:** A group of soy balloons
**Oxide**: (ox +hide | oxide)

## Consumption
The taste and nutritional value of green milk/soy: The description only mentions that green milk is made from soy, but it does not provide any information about the taste or nutritional value of the substance.

## Harvesting
The process of harvesting and producing green milk/soy: While the description mentions that green milk is harvested from the coats of fallen Aeroxen, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how the milk is produced or processed.

## Culture
The cultural significance of green milk/soy: The description mentions that green milk has both recreational and practical uses, but it does not provide any information about the cultural significance of the substance in the Asian subcontinent.

## Environmental Impact
The environmental impact of green milk/soy production: The description mentions that the harvesting of Aeroxen has resulted in controversy and ecological damage, but it does not provide a detailed explanation of the environmental impact of green milk/soy production.

In the Asian fantasy setting where green milk is produced, it has become an important commodity with a significant impact on the economy. Green milk's mild levitation property makes it a valuable resource for transportation, particularly for air travel. As a result, there is a high demand for green milk for use in various transportation devices such as soy balloons and aero-decks.

The harvesting of green milk has also become an industry of its own, providing jobs and income for many people. The Aeroxen, the creatures from which green milk is harvested, are hunted for their valuable coats, which contain the phloxide substance used to create green milk. This hunting activity has also created a market for hunting equipment such as harpoons and spring guns.

The trade of green milk has become a significant source of income for many businesses and individuals, particularly in the transportation industry. The increasing demand for green milk has resulted in price fluctuations, with the price of green milk varying depending on the availability of the substance and the demand for it.

Overall, green milk has had a significant impact on the economy of the Asian fantasy setting where it is produced, providing jobs and income for many people and creating a valuable resource for transportation.

# Saint Omlo

Olmes, elmo’s

Fire of St. Omlo:
Omlo captured by “heathens” for preaching, along with rest of congregation.
Raining
On ship. Omlo is brought above deck. Receives nine tails.
The fifth crack of the cat was accompanied by thunder, which struck the mast.
Purple flames spread across the rigging.
The heathens jump ship, leaving the captives for dead.
~~This was St. Omlo’s miracle,~~ when the heathen’s had abandoned them, they left the sails up. St. Omlo freed the captives, and they sailed home.

What about fire?
Don’t you see? St. Omlo was an illusionist.

Acthnici - St. Omlo’s salamander, and the symbol of St. Omlo.

Nowadays st. Omlo’s fire is used on ships to provide light, without the fire risk.

**\[Players are sent to find a lich]**
“Believe you me, I am a leech!, not a lich. We are very different, but I can see how one would make that mistake. You see, a leech studies leechcraft, or medicine. A lich practices lichcraft, the dead.”

**\[Players comment on location]**
“Apologies for the exterior, it can be… alot. Ha!, we don’t get many visitors.”

“Oh yes! The village. Such a shame, it was once a nice place, I was the doctor you see. One particularly harsh month, we were struck by a wave of the flu. A landslide had cut us off from the outside world, so my shipment of medicinal supplies quickly ran thin. When this happened, I locked myself inside this place to keep from catching anything. I'm not proud of it, but there wasn’t anything I could do for them.

Well when the season was over, we didn’t have enough people to harvest the fields, and the crops died right there. Not enough food for the next winter, most either left for greener pastures, or were buried.

### Seelie (Blessed) Court

The Seelie Court is a group of fairies, often specified as good fairies who contrast with the wicked Unseelie Court.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seelie#cite_note-6) Seelie Court were those fairies who would seek help from humans, warn those who have accidentally offended them, and return human kindness with favors of their own. Still, a fairy belonging to this court would avenge insults and could be prone to mischief.

Early human settlers calling them “Seelie," similar to names such as "good neighbors," may have been a euphemism to ward off their anger.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seelie#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seelie#cite_note-JG2-3)

**Seilie wichts**

Seilie Witchts, literally translating to “blessed beings” are “legendary nature spirits, similar to but distinct from fairies/fey.”[[1]](#footnote-0) Generally, they belong to

### Unselie (Wicked)Court

Unseelie Court were the darkly-inclined fairies who would attack without provocation. Briggs equated the Unseelie Court with the [Sluagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluagh) (who abducted travelers at night and fired [elf-shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfshot)) as well as the [shellycoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellycoat), [nuckelavee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuckelavee), [redcaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcap), [baobhan sith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baobhan_sith), and various other wicked fairies

Wights

Summer fey (seelie) are considered "good" to those that know nothing of fey. They represent growth, warmth, beginnings. Life. They hold beauty above all else. Whimsical, but def not good.

The winter fey (unseelie) represent cold, death, and the eventual decay of everything. They're usually viewed as "bad" (even though they're not). They usually hold something akin to duty above all else. A little cold hearted but not evil.

# Fey

Sane fey are still holden to the values of their wild counterparts, in that they have much love for paperwork (See hilda), but are unlikely to “take” names.
