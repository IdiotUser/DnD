Wizard makes city with magic
Goes wrong
Keeps expanding 
Shifted to different plane
Still expands there

  

  

  

Con insides with the fall?
Massive dungeon?
Closer to centre, straighter/more maze like the roads?
Small pockets of utilitied buildings?
Fast travel infuture?  Tears through the weave to create portals to and from?
- Time travels slower?
- None Euclidean? (Nether)
Siphons off small amount of the weave for the city to grow/ect., that is why no lvl 9+ spells?
In the centre is the architect, who is only semi conscious and lives on the weave (original wizard caster for city) 
Cult of the architect?  Free masons?
