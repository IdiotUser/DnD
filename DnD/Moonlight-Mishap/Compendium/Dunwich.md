# Hag's Head
The [[#Hag's Head]] is an establishment located in Old Dunwich, frequented by [[Witchers]].
During their campaign as soldiers, the bar was a favourite for those of duty, a way-station for the weary and unwanted.

While [Knights](Knights%20of%20Sorrow.md) are not barred entry to the [[#Hag's Head]], they are seldom seen in attendance, preferring to keep to their [tower](Tower%20of%20Sorrow.md) and accommodation in [[Dunwich]] afforded to them by [[Sorrow]] himself.

The [[#Hag's Head]] funding is provided by the monarch as a retirement package for the [King's Contingents](Witchers#King's Contingent), a point often reiterated by [Knights](Knights%20of%20Sorrow.md) when they come "to visit".
