“Dear Herm West

We are interested in what you propose, the arcane users sound promising, however we are more interested in the aforementioned Rat and Druid, this news has caused quite a buzz here, a second kind of the creature can prove now that this may be a new emerging species, we must study its body, we must study its brain. We have already ordered a witcher to collect both you and the “delivery men” here at once; of course you will be rewarded for such fine specimens.

  

I wish you luck

Victor Mongele”

  

“I took some myself to see, every good doctor should, my god i'm still alive but i see him, when i'm awake and in my restless dreams he's there, Yellow and grand, I am a man of science but, something i've put into this thing, is either hallucinatory, or something otherworldy

  

“Dear Herm West

We are delighted to receive your letter and research, your work is quite the current craze at the DSA. There have been talks of benefactors to provide additional resources to you, the package of Amygdala has been dispatched via our outsourcing post service.

  

We wish you well

I wish you well
