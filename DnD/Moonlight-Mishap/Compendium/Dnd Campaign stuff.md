## The Earth

The earth is infused with the essence of magic, it is unknown how or where magic originated from within the soul, but some believe it was a gift from the gods, and others believe it is the source of life itself.

  

## Religion

### The 10 Above(Petrasm)

Spread across Halglond there lie 10 different obelisks, each one with a carved symbol in the stone, and a name and title. Noone knows where these obelisks have come from, as they have been here long before anything else in history. This religion of 10 is followed depending on race, but exclusively followed by the Vistani people, Many druids, Elves and Dwarves of the land.

### The 1 above all(Dolorism)

  

But since the discovering of these obelisk they have become divine and holy for many races, unifying under a single religion worshiping The 10 Above, however centuries ago, when man was in its infancy, a man called Dimitri Sorrow said to have discovered an 11th Obelisk, becoming intune he said it spoke to him and commanded him to build up to the heavens, to meet his one true god, Liftreo. As such Dimitri, now St Sorrow, constructed the very first church of the 1 above all, and began his teachings to people and races, spreading his religion vastly. Meanwhile his followers and him constructed The Tower of Sorrow, a monolithic tower scaling over 4 miles in height, and even more in width. Trumping mountains, and becoming one of the most holy sights in Halglond. They say St Sorrow is still up at the top, building and answering to Liftroes divine commands, hoping to one day breach the gap between Man and God.

## The 4 sons

While technically gods, these 4 devilish entities instill many a misery across Halglond, having bound not to any obelisks, their notoriety as immortal and maysticall beings have placed them the center of many a cult and religion. Their names have derived from the entities themselves, Although some are unsure if these names are true.

## Races

The first prominent intelligent races to roam Hemwick were Humans, Orcs and elves. Both Humans and Elves flourished with their higher brain function, adapting and learning, whilst orcs were still more intelligent than most life at the time, they were unable to evolve to the extent humans and elves did.

  

### Humans

Humans evolved alongside elves and split into many different ethnicities across the land of hemwick.

#### Glenkiesh

The Gluekiesh (singular Kieshi), are the primary human people within Halglond, Glekiesh people expanded outwards from The Tower of Sorroe  across the land, cultivating lands and clearing forests for space, whilst also spreading their religion. In the early days of expansion Glekiesh gave little regard for other races or other ethnicities of humans. This extended to the Vistani people, who were layers of the natural land, being pushed out of areas and settlements, in order to take up more lands. For orcs however, Glenkish led a crusade against their kind, who were still in an infancy unlike elves and humans. Orcs were eradicated in the 20 year crusade across Halglond.

.

##### Believes

- Liftreo controls death and souls in the afterlife
    
- The Vistani people are filthy hermits who travel the lands looking to trick and steal
    
- While magic is understood they still find extreme magic users unappealing and inhuman
    
- Unrestful souls are cursed from their sins to Liftreo
    
- The 4 sons are traitors of the land and life, causer of all misery in the world
    

  

#### Vistanit

The Vistani (Singular Vistana) were once the cultivators of Hemwick as a human race, living off the land and in turn worshiping it. Their people once lived in small settlements which housed many Vistani together as one big family, from which these communes worshiped the lands. From This worship came the connection to their gods and magic itself. Growing alongside Glenkiesh until their expansion, the Vistani were eventually pushed from their settlements and travel now around Halglond, from village to village setting up caravans and providing different trades to anyone who comes across. Being so intune with magic they have divine knowledge of the past, and vague knowledge of the future if they channel their power, offering to read fortunes and the future of travelers who come by. Using money they make from their travels Vistani indulge in a lavish lifestyle of music, Alcohol and silk adorned homes.

  

Vistani religion follows the 10 above including Raum and Paimon as their entrust of death, knowledge, soul and night. Vistani include in their superstition that Raum is in love with Paimon, carrying souls to Paimon as gift of their love, hoping to earn their favor. Vistani see crows as visages of raum passing souls onto Paimon, and harming a crow would prevent a soul from passing into the afterlife.

  

##### Believes

- The 10 above are the true gods
    
- Glenkish people are foolish and easy to manipulate for money
    
- The mind and soul are separate, Spirits are souls unable to cross over to reincarnate through Paimons devine library
    
- Crows are the collector of souls for Paimon, and harming a crow is said to prevent Paimon from claiming a soul for the afterlife

## Magic

The magic of the earth was imbued long ago by. Every living creature is dormant with magic, and can access it through their genes in various manners. Most commers who become magic users experience the growth of a secondary organ which helps spread magic through the body, this magic being used can clog up the bloodstream, so this organ, called a Heelbar,  filtered the magic “tar” through the body so as to not kill the user. Through this process the more powerful and longer someone uses magic the more their body undergoes changes. Limbs may grow longer, skin may begin to go pale, pupils may shrink. This varies from race to race.

  

Another way people can access magic is through patrons and gods. Those who worship the land such as Vistani and Druids gain their magic through their gods, who provide divine magic which does not need filtering through the body or a secondary organ growth.

  

People born of Vistani and druids inherit this and pass it down for generations. This goes for other magic beings and their bloodline as well. Magic can be inherited, however this gives an already naturally grown organ, which is stronger than those who must grow it.

  

Heelbars of great size and age sell for high prices, as the tar within a magic user's body is also usable in magic potions and arcane liquids as ingredients to further their potency.
