Cearl functions as an informant for [[Hodge]].  As a private investigator, when investigating disappearances often lead to monsters.  This is where Hodge comes in.

The two are good friends, hard to come by in such a line of work that requires constant travel.  They have spent long, silent days in a tree, waiting in ambush for a monster to return to its territory after a kill.
