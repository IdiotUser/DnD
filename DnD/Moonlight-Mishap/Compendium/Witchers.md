# History
%%Describe in detail what the history of the faction is up until the current point. Try to make it interesting and informative while not being too long of a read.%%
The [King's Witchers](Witchers.md#King's%20Contingent) were warranted specialists, tasked with the eradication of heretical (arcane; magic not of the gods) magicks, such as those of the druids, [[Vistani]], ect.  Broadly, these heretics were referred to as "*[[witches]]*".

In time, as the [[Vistani]]'s numbers dwindled and the remaining few went into hiding, the once numerous [[Witchers]]' ranks followed suite.  As they died off or retired, there was no need to sustain such an expensive, specialised unit to hunt an already defeated enemy.  Between missions, many Witchers had already begun hunting various beasts and monstrosities at the behest of the common-folk.  As the contingent's funding decreased year-by-year, more and more Witchers deserted to become full-fledge monster-hunters.  

This was confounded when the new king was crowned.  One of his first items of legislation was to disband the already shambling contingent.  A ceremony was held in [[Capitol]], of which only few of the remaining Witchers attended.

During the reign of king [[Sorrow]], the king reinstated the King's Contingent as the [[Knights of Sorrow]].  These knights follow the old ways of the Witchers, during the time of the [[Vistani eradication]].
