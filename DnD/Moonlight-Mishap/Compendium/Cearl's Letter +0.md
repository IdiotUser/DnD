My dearest friend [Bob](Hodge)[^3],

I’m writing this to you from [[Arkham]], where I had been on the search for a little girl, now realising I might be out of my league. In my pursuit through some woods I came across a small party of 3 [['Herbologists']] I assume, they said they were looking for flowers. But where they were coming from and what they said struck me as odd for researchers in that field. They asked me if I had seen a [[Wendigo]] or [[skinwalker]], my I hadn’t heard that name since when I was a wee fella and my daddy taught me stories, but it shook me and i kept my composure. I asked around [[Arkham]] later that night[^4] and learnt they were staying at the [Drunken Hag Cabins](Arkham#Drunken Hag Cabins), just across from the [old church](Arkham.md#Old%20church). Maybe you could help them, before they get themselves killed out here. Winter is coming, the first snow has already fallen, I pray[^2] for you all. Keep them safe, who knows, they’re an odd bunch you could use some help in crusade[^1].

Your friend always, [[Cearl]].

[^1]: What crusade, Cearl?
[^2]: Are you religious Cearl?
[^3]: Secret message?
[^4]: You say it took 1 day for the letter to arrive.
