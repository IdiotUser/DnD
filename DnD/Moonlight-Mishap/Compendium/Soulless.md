Where is his soul?

## Inciting Incident

How does one lose their soul?
- To a witch?
- In a fight?
- Being too trusting?
- killing a crow?



As a child, [[Hodge]] was plagued with nightmares.  In an attempt to ease his suffering, his sister (a witch), performed some magic, resulting in the loss of his and an inability to dream.

Did his older brother force her to do it?

## Affects

Immune to divine magics, no healing, scrying or the like.
Cannot be resurrected, but raise dead functions similarly.
Cannot dream - dreams are an effect of the soul
Relationship to mundane magic?


Thoughts on the soul:  
The soul is condensed form the weave?  
The flow of souls is equivalent to the weave.  
Divine magic is magic as it relates to the soul, magic from souls.  
Worship provides such energy to gods.  
Restraint is a form of worship. (Oaths, vows, commandments, ect.)  
The soul is required for such transference of energy from worshiper to worshiped.
Theoretically, without a soul, the energy may still be generated from worship, however such divine beings as gods would be unable to harness it.  
Theoretically, one could design a structure to harness these rogue energies, if only there were a way to direct them.  
Theoretically, a holy crusade of the soulless would generate viable energy that, if unfettered by divine beings, would be collected by a structure, into a form that may be further refined to allow for the abilities of gods, without their aid. Such unholy magics may even be usable by the mortal, or almost mortal.


Divine - of or relating to the soul
	Holy - That that is powered by energies generated from the soul
	Infernal - that that is powered by the consumption of the raw magic of the soul.  instead of the soul as the generator, it is fuel.
Arcane - of or relating to 

magic may be powered by many things.
Divine magic is that that is powered by worship.  Gods harness the power of worship through a conduit, that being the soul.  Such magic is renewable as long as one allows the soul to charge more magics.
Infernal magic is powered by the use of the residual magics of the soul.  Such magic consumes the soul.
Arcane magic is that of the direct manipulation of the weave.


The soul is the conduit for magic,
without a soul energy may still be generate, but not discharged in the conventional way.

Self worship allows for one to harness the energies directed by the conduit, with one's own will.  This may be referred to as willpower.  It is a powerful concept, as the generated energies of worship are not diminished in the same way as in that of the divine.  However, due to the fact that only one worshiper is present, there is less capacity for magic.  As such, it would require one of supreme will to cast with will alone.
Perhaps there exists some cases of godless paladins whose magic comes from an oath not to the divine, but to one's self.

The knowledge of the true names of things allows for their direct manipulation.
