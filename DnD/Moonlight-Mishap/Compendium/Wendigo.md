[![The Wendigo – Elysium|300](https://rebeccaelysium.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/wendigo-watermarked.png?w=1400)

>*“The Wendigo was gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it had were tattered and bloody … Unclean and suffering from suppuration of the flesh, the Wendigo gave off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption.”*

Tracks like that of an elongated bear.
