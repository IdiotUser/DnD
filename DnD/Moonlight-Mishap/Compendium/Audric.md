*An excerpt of Hodge's fifth letter to Cearl while in the company of the 'Herbologists'*

We first encountered Mr. Audric Herheist *(henceforth to be referred to as Audric as his title is tied to his lands, lands of which do not manifest within our experienced realities)* During our encounter with the shadows of the [[Mist]].  He demonstrated an uncanny ability of control over the beasts,[^1] Dispelling them with little more than a whistle.  (From what I heard after the excitement, although I expect [[Xander]] may be prone to exaggeration).

I must admit I did not conduct the ensuing conversation... Admirably, shall we say, although in my defence the prospect of adjacent realities was far more intriguing than I had expected *(I'm sure you too are intrigued.  more to be discussed later?)*  I began with the best intensions, aiming to conduct a quick examination of the mysterious figure whom had emerged from the [[Mist]] without so much as a scratch from the shadows.

A brief description of our visitor:
Human Male (possibly Vistani); tall (approx. 6'); muscular, although showing signs of malnourishment; Dressed lavishly in a rich blue, tailored affair.

He explained *(completely unprompted, might I add)*:
- He had been trapped within the mist for several days,
- The shadows had not attacked him, although he summoned a manaphyical dome to rest within (of which the components need for had been dwindling),
- He had recently run out of rations,
- He hailed from an adjacent[^2] Prime Material Plane, 
	- in which he was a noble,
	- There was a medium sized town called dunwich,
	- There were no [[obelisks]].

[^1]: Note:  I doubt they could be classified as such, my working theory is that they are the the souls of those that have become lost between realities.  Undead, I would presume, due to their incorporeal , and vicious nature.
