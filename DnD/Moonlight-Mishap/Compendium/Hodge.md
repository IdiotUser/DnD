Hodge Van Helsing
Hodge Van Hopkins?

# Appearance
Blistered right hand.

# Childhood
%%Born where and to what type of household\[.]%%


---
%%What lead them to want to become a Witcher/or \[were] they born into it\[.]%%


---
%%Their first experience killing a monster of any kind\[.]%%
[Hodge's](Hodge.md) first experience hunting a witch was with his father as a *"wee fella"*.  They were following reports of \[STRANGE STUFF] 

---
%%A different experience that haunts them(maybe they had to kill a small child who couldn’t control[^1] her powers and it was the only option\[).]%%


---
%%having met a friend for whatever reason, The cleric or Cearl the hunter%%
[[Hodge]] and [[Cearl]] met in the field.  Quite literally, [[Cearl]] stepped on a sleeping [[Hodge]] as he was bumbling through the field, in search of his quarry.

---
%%Some sort of turmoil maybe? Something that sent them down a different path/conflicts in their life%%
