**Local area:**

## The Town:
**Name:**
**Local Inn:**


Everyone is huddled together in the inn because its cold outside and has the best weatherproofing.  Old man comes running in, shaken, and speaks of a carter’s load overturned and blood trails leading off into the forest.  Who will help the carter?

Word of the old silver mine (original purpose of town, since emptied) suggests that there are wargles/ratfolk in there loitering, multiplying.

_Down, down, down, past the magic mouth, toward the eyes in the dark._  (Dave Trampier from the AD&D Players Handbook, TSR, 1978.)


Retired campaigner (ranger) lives in a secluded shack in a clearing in the forest.

In your youth, a common dare was to see how close to the shack you could get before the one-armed ranger came screaming out and you’d run back to town.

Ranger is the only one that knows the way to the old druid circle.

The Drudic circle is dilapidated, more than overgrown.

Fight magic plants.

One druid remains.

After overgrowth is slain, the druid emerges from the forest and “attacks” the party.

  

  

  

# Available classes:

Flavour text describes the “masters” of class “apprenticeships”.  I.e: The ones who teach.

## Druid “That old hermit, which lives woods”

## Ranger 
_“The woodsman”_

There is a man who lives in the woods.  They call him… the woodsman.

## Fighter

None such specific master of fighters.

Rather I have some examples of possible was to learn this power:


**“natural talent”**

Your childhood bully.  Apt in the art of not being you, none believed your claims of being bullied, for they were such a “sweet child” and “couldn’t hurt a fly” while you had a reputation for “fibbing” and “a nasty habit of making it up.”  Now, when the prospect of being the “hero of the hour” finally becomes a reality, they appear to show remorse, and treat you kindly so as to preserve their self image.  This, of course, won’t last, and already they threaten to beat you if you do not join the hunt willingly.

## Rogue

**Street urchin**
A small, scrawny young lad.  After their father had 

**Trickster**

**Buillied**
Years of honing your craft by running from bullies, you’ve learned to stay hidden, evade, and outrun your would-be-assailants.

## Wizard
_“Squizard’s squire”_

A pet of the squizard.  A living puppet.

  

## Sorcerer
Spellborn
Warlock
Cleric “Priest”

"**protégé**" (or "protégée" for females) implies there's a certain degree of care and protection involved, and often suggests the protégé is involved in similar activity to the mentor

"**ward**" implies being under the direct, explicit protection of the protector, but wardships usually exist because the ward is incapable (legally or mentally) of handling their own affairs
  
"**disciple**" tends to invoke the idea of faith, and belief in the patron or in their beliefs (and their particular approach to them); it's usually more philosophical than physical

"**vassal**" is a good one, implying subservience and fealty in exchange for protection; but like "ward" it suggests the patron would take explicit action to protect the vassal

"**thrall**" is similar to "servant," but suggests a degree of compulsion; it's more akin to "mental slave"

"**servant**" is broad enough it might be the best option if you want something that has few social implications

"**underling**" might work, as it's close to "servant," but it might evoke the idea of being a flunky (only doing menial tasks, not really of much worth)
