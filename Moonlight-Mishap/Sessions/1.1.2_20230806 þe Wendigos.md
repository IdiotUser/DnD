# Log
[[Hodge]] Receives a [letter](Cearl's%20Letter%20+0.md) from [[Cearl]], informing him of 3 herbologists who speak of a [[Wendigo]].

[[Hodge]] sets out to [[Arkham]] to find the children.

On the way, [[Hodge]] finds evidence of 4 sets of tracks in a clearing, leading to [[Arkham]].
1. [Elongated bear tracks](Wendigo.md) 
2. Commoner's shoes, Medium weight
3. Commoner's shoes, Medium weight
4. Large [rat tracks](Skaven), Medium weight (humanoid)
The bear tracks were fresher than those of the others, leading [[Hodge]] to believe that the bear was following them.

It begins to snow.

---
Time passes, it is snowing heavily by the time [[Hodge]] enters the town of [[Arkham]] and heads to the [tavern](Arkham.md#Tavern) to locate the cabins.

Hilarity ensues.  A sense of deja vu floods all but [[Hodge]].

Watch 2 herbologists enter [[Arkham#Þe General Store]].
