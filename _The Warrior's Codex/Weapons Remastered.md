# Weapons Remastered
This chapter massively expands the original Weapons Remastered originally created by an anonymous author, which can be found [here](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/H1vHNJOuG).  Both exist to diversify weapons' use and function in [[combat]].  This chapter is not an attempt to increase the power of weapons or the martial characters that use them.  Instead, it attempts to emulate the variety of options and effects found in their cantrip counterparts, and make martial [[combat]] less boring and weapon choice more significant.  It also hopes to imitate weapons' uses and specialties in real life—with significant abstraction.

While the properties included here do increase power levels, the ultimate goal is diversification, and the overall increase is minimal. It also attempts to remove the universal popularity of some weapons (such as the rapier for Dexterity-based fighters) in situations where it might be more realistic to use another weapon, and instead make all weapons viable.

To make this possible, each weapon has a combination of several unique properties, which add new functions, passive bonuses, or abilities in combat. Many entirely new weapons join the existing roster, including some weapons of great tactical value in historical battlefields which 5e neglected, as well as some exotic or exciting options.

Ideally, players will intuit and remember properties easily.  Properties, in most cases, adhere to the design philosophy of 5e—most are relatively simple or expand mechanics that already existed. Ultimately, using this section should have few negatives, for massive gains in fun factor.

In some cases, these properties overlap with feats, a difficult problem.  On one hand, martial characters' progression encourages them to take feats—they are designed with feats in mind. On the other, the removal of "feat taxes" (feats necessary to make builds viable) is an admirable goal.  As a result, properties that overlap with feats are designed as smaller bonuses that can be combined with their corresponding feat. Since said feats provide much larger bonuses, and so remain the superior option.  As a specialization with a significant opportunity cost, the reward should be large. This remains the case.

Ultimately, this section gives martial players tactical options and nuance that characters without magic or superiority dice sorely lacked.

To those unused to these options, this is sudden, glaring change.  Its scope daunts newcoming players and Dungeon Masters alike.  However, spellcasters already track far more options and resources, and they operate beautifully. There is no reason martials can't do the same.

As time passes, most warriors will find their favorites, memorize those options, and remain loyal to their preferred style.  The key word is style.  No longer is a longsword interchangeable with a battleaxe, or a spear with a javelin.  Aesthetic choices have real meaning, and differentiate unique player characters even more.  This mechanical and stylistic diversity is the ultimate benefit of tabletop roleplay over other games, and this remaster helps that aspect shine.

## Weapon properties
This section describes every property that The Warrior's Codex applies to weapons. When a weapon is used to attack in a way that differs from its intended use (such as striking an enemy with the butt of a gun), the weapon has no properties.

### Ammunition
These weapons can be used to make a ranged attack, provided you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack you make with this weapon (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of a battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking 1 minute to search the battlefield. 
### Bypass
These flexible weapons wrap around shields and other personal defences. When you attack with a bypass weapon, you ignore the AC bonus granted by shields and features that parry or deflect attacks.
### Cavalry
These weapons are well-suited to combat on the move. If you damage a creature with a cavalry weapon after moving at least 20 feet straight toward a target while mounted, you deal an extra 1d6 damage.
### Ensnaring
These weapons feature chains, hooks, and other entangling components. When you hit with an ensnaring weapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to shove the target prone, pull or shove it into a space within 5 feet of you, or disarm it (DMG page 271). If your roll requires you to use your Strength (Athletics) bonus, you can add your weapon's attack bonus instead. When you attempt to disarm a creature using a weapon with the ensnaring property, you do not have disadvantage on the roll if the target is larger than you.
### Finnesse
These precise weapons lend themselves to dextrous combat. When you attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
### Finisher
These brutal weapons are well-suited to executing enemies at your mercy. When you damage a prone creature with a weapon with the finisher property, you roll the weapon's damage dice, as listed on the table, an additional time.

> [!info] Property Damage Dice
> Effects such as a [[barbarian]]'s [[Barbarian#Brutal Critical|Brutal Critical]] feature or the Great Weapon Fighting fighting style do not affect damage dice granted by properties such as finisher and wind-up, since bonus damage dice from properties are not weapon damage dice. 
For example, when a 9th-level barbarian lands a critical hit with a greatsword against a prone enemy, they roll 10d6 damage; 2d6 from the weapon, another 2d6 from finisher, which are both doubled by the critical hit, and a final 2d6 from Brutal Critical. While finisher's dice are rolled again by the critical hit, they are not weapon damage dice that Brutal Critical adds once more.
Similarly, a [[fighter]] with the [[Fighter#Great Weapon Fighting|Great Weapon Fighting style]] that strikes an enemy with a wound-up pike can only reroll a 1 or 2 on the 1d10 rolled by the pike itself, not the remaining 2d10 granted by the wind-up property.
### Gunpowder
These weapons utilize volatile powder as a propellant to fire projectiles or explode. They cannot be used underwater, and ammunition from these weapons cannot be reused. When you attack, the weapon flashes, expels smoke, and creates a bang that can be heard up to 300 feet away. You can reload a gunpowder weapon in place of a single weapon attack on your turn, or with the Use An Object action. Reloading consumes both a charge of powder and a piece of ammunition.
Carrying too much powder is risky. When some items with this property take fire or lightning damage, they explode. The saving throw and damage are listed in their descriptions. When a weapon with the gunpowder property takes fire or lightning damage when loaded, it discharges, and must be reloaded before being fired again.
### Heavy
These weapons are unwieldier than most. Unless a creature has a Strength score of 13 or higher, it has disadvantage on attacks made with heavy weapons. A Small or smaller creature always suffers this disadvantage. A creature with a Strength score lower than 13 cannot use a shield with the heavy property to increase its AC, and has disadvantage on attack rolls made to bash with it.
Before you make an attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can forego adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll. This ability can be used in conjunction with the Great Weapon Master feat.
### Light
These weapons are small and easy to handle, making them ideal for use in an off-hand or fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in Part IV.
### Loading
These weapons take extra time to load with ammunition and fire. As a result, you can make only one attack with them when you attack as an action, bonus action, or reaction, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
### Nonlethal
These weapons are designed to incapacitate, or are otherwise capable of delivering a hit that does not kill the target. When you choose to knock a creature out instead of killing it, nonlethal weapons deal their normal damage. See Part IV for rules regarding knocking a creature out.
### Parry
When you are hit by a melee attack while wielding a weapon with the parry property that you are proficient with, you can use your reaction to add half your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing it to miss. If you do so while wielding two parrying weapons, you add your entire proficiency bonus instead.
### Prone Fighting
When you are prone and make a weapon attack with this weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage for being prone.
### Ranged
These weapons attack at a distance, making ranged attacks instead of melee. Their range is listed in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property, and lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range. Some ranged weapons have a Strength requirement listed. You cannot make ranged attack rolls with that ranged weapon if your Strength is lower than that value.
### Reach
These weapons' extended length adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with them, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks. Reach weapons cannot be used for two-weapon fighting, regardless of your strength or feats.
### Skewering
These precise weapons reward focused attacks and punch holes in enemy defenses. When an attack roll with a skewering weapon exceeds the target's AC by 5 or more (or lands a critical hit), the next attack roll made against the target gains a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.

> [!info] Proficiency Bonus & Skewering
>While the rules disallow stacking proficiency bonuses, the skewering property allows you to add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll multiple times—once from the roll and once from the bonus inflicted by the *skewering* property on a previous attack you made on your turn.
### Slicing
These wicked weapons cut gaping wounds into the flesh, causing profuse bleeding. When an attack roll with a slicing weapon exceeds the target's AC by 5 or more (or lands a critical hit), the target takes additional necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Constructs, elementals, most undead, and other targets that do not bleed may be immune to this damage at the discretion of your DM.
### Special
Special weapons have entirely unique attributes, detailed after the weapon charts.
### Staggering
These hard-hitting weapons daze on impact. When an attack roll with a staggering weapon exceeds the target's AC by 5 or more (or lands a critical hit), it has disadvantage on the next ability check it makes before the start of its next turn.
### Sundering
These weapons crush, break, or penetrate armor. When you attack an object, or a target wearing any medium or heavy armor (other than hide) with a sundering weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll. You also gain this bonus against creatures with thick shells, metallic hides, and other creatures at the discretion of your DM. Sundering weapons also ignore damage reduction granted by armor.
### Sweeping
These weapons strike in broad swings. When you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points with a sweeping weapon, you can target another creature within 5 feet of the first that you can reach and, if the original attack roll would hit it, apply any remaining damage to it. If that creature is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to kill an enemy.
### Thrown
These weapons can be thrown out of your hand to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for attack and damage rolls that you would use for a melee attack with it. The normal and long ranges of a weapon with the thrown property increase by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Strength modifier, unless your Strength modifier is negative.
### Two-Handed
These cumbersome weapons must be wielded in two hands to make attacks. If one of your hands is occupied by performing somatic components, grappling, etc, you cannot attack with this weapon until you return your hand to the weapon. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
### Variable
These weapons can deal multiple damage types, and inflict different effects as a result. When you attack with a variable weapon, it gains the corresponding property for that attack: Bludgeoning attacks gain the staggering property, piercing attacks gain skewering, and slashing attacks gain slicing.
### Versatile
These weapons can be wielded in one or both hands. When you wield a versatile weapon in two hands, it gains an additional property and uses different damage dice, both listed in parentheses behind the versatile property on the weapons table. See the rules for versatile fighting in Part IV.
### Wind-up
These weapons can be devastating when prepared for the right moment. In place of a weapon attack, you can wind up your weapon or brace it against the ground, depending on the weapon's design. The next time you hit with the wound-up weapon before the start of your next turn, you can roll two additional damage dice. After the attack, the weapon is no longer wound-up. A wound-up melee weapon can be used to make an opportunity attack with advantage when a hostile creature that you can see enters your reach.
 
### Winged
These weapons prevent targets from approaching and can catch weapons. You can use a bonus action to attempt to disarm a creature within reach using a winged weapon.
After you damage a creature you could grapple with a winged weapon, the target cannot move straight toward you and the area within your reach is difficult terrain for it until it leaves your reach or you attack with the weapon again.
While holding a creature in this way, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove it. The hold ends if you shove the target outside the weapon's reach.
If one of the above rolls uses your Strength (Athletics) bonus, you can add the weapon's attack bonus instead.

> [!info] Exotic Weapons
> Exotic weapons are unwieldy, niche, novel, or revolutionary. Some are less effective weapons than popularly imagined or were designed for as tools used outside of combat, and so require expertise to use in combat with the same effectiveness as other, more efficient weapons. However, because they are still weapons, they work in the same way as simple or martial weapons whenever a class feature, spell, or During character creation, if you gain proficiency in all simple and martial weapons, you also gain proficiency in one exotic weapon or shield of your choice. A monk gains proficiency in two exotic weapons of your choice. Multi- classing into a class, other than [[monk]], does not grant additional exotic proficiencies. You can also gain proficiency in an exotic weapon from other race, class, or background features, training, or by taking the *Weapon Master* Feat.

## Shield Grips
Shield grips determine how you hold a shield.
**Handles** are a wood or metal handlebar on the inside of a shield. These shields can be doffed or donned with the item interaction you receive as part of your turn and can be dropped freely, but enemies have advantage on checks made to disarm you of them.
**Straps** attach the shield to the arms, reinforcing the handle with a series of cloth or leather straps. These shields take an action to don or doff, and enemies have disadvantage on checks made to disarm you of the shield.

## Shield Attacks
When you could attack with a weapon, you can instead choose to bash with a shield. You add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll so long as you are proficient with the shield you use, and your Strength modifier to its damage.
Shields are not considered weapons, so you can still benefit from features like the Dueling fighting style when attacking with a weapon while you have a shield in the other hand. However, because the attack you make with a shield is a melee weapon attack, it can activate features that activate on weapon attacks, such as [[Paladin#Divine Smite|Divine Smite]].
A magical shield that grants a bonus to your AC when wielded only increases your Armor Class, and does not grant a bonus to attack and damage rolls with the shield unless its description states otherwise.
If a magical shield applies its bonus to both AC and attack and damage rolls, its rarity increases by one level. For example, both a +3 weapon and +3 shield are very rare items, but a dueling shield that grants a +3 bonus to both AC and attack and damage rolls is a legendary item.

## Special Weapon Properties
Many weapons have entirely unique attributes, whose abilities cannot be replicated with existing properties. These capabilities are listed below.

***Atlatl.*** The atlatl benefits from skill with both ranged and thrown weapons, though it is considered a ranged weapon. You can use your Strength modifier to increase the range of darts hurled with this weapon, as though it had the thrown property, and it and its darts are considered thrown weapons when used to make ranged attacks for the purposes of benefits such as the Thrown Weapon Fighting fighting style.

***Boomerang.*** This weapon returns to your hand if you miss. Blowgun. If you are hidden when you attack with this weapon, you do not reveal your location.

***Blowgun Needle.*** These minute needles are small enough that a single dose of poison can be spread further. When you apply a poison to them blowgun needles, a single dose covers 10 pieces of this ammunition, instead of the usual 3.

***Cestus.*** Cestus are not held in the hand but are wrapped around the knuckles and forearm. or worn as gloves. If you are wielding a cestus, you can use that hand to grapple or shove an enemy, or load a ranged weapon, but you cannot attack with that cestus without ending the grapple.
You cannot wield other weapons or shields in that hand, nor use it to perform somatic components. You cannot drop a cestus or be disarmed of one unless you are incapacitated.  You must use an action to don or doff a cestus, but can don or doff a pair of cestus in one action.

***Dueling Shield.*** These large shields have a large triangular boss and hooks and blades built into the rim. A dueling shield adds a +2 bonus to AC when wielded in one hand, as normal.  When wielded in both hands, it acts as amelee weapon that deals 1d8 piercing damage with the ensnaring, heavy, and parry properties in addition to its AC bonus.

***Firecage Arrow.*** The curved metal bars that flare out from the shaft of this arrow carry a burning coal through the air, which sheds dim light in a 5 ft. radius. When you hit with a firecage arrow, half the damage you deal is fire damage, instead of piercing. If you miss with a firecage arrow, choose a space within 15 feet of the target. The arrow ignites objects in that space that aren't being worn or carried.

***Garotte Wire.*** A garotte cannot be used on a creature more than 1 size larger than you, and you can only attack with a garotte if you have advantage on attack rolls against the target.
On a hit, the target is grappled until you release it, it breaks free of the grapple, or you stop wielding the garotte. While grappled in this way, the target is restrained, cannot speak or breathe, and suffocates (PHB 183). Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to a garotte wire's choke at the discretion of the DM.
If you are grappling a creature, you can grip the wire with the same hand that you are using to grapple the target and attack it was a garotte wire that you are holding in the other hand, effectively ignoring the wire's two-handed property for that target.

***Gauntlet-Sword.*** This specialized sword is built into a stiff gauntlet. You cannot drop or be disarmed of a gauntlet-sword. It takes an action to don or doff a gauntlet sword.

***Grapeshot.*** Instead of a single bullet, a large number of tiny projectiles fill acanister of grapeshot ammunition. Upon firing, the projectiles fly in a line 5 feet wide and as long as the gun's normal range. You can target a number of creatures in that line equal to your proficiency bonus, making new attack rolls for each creature.

***Greatbow.*** An enormous bow with massive draw weight, you must use Strength instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

***Hooksword.*** If you are holding a hooksword in each hand, checks from the weapon's ensnaring property are made with advantage, and the ability to link both hookswords together gives this weapon the sweeping property.

***Kite Shield.*** If you wield this shield while mounted, its long, tapering bottom grants both you and your mount a +1 bonus to AC against attacks.

***Lance.*** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. A lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

***Lantern Shield.*** An apparatus combining a small shield, lantern, a gauntlet, and several blades. When wielded, it adds a +2 bonus to your AC like a normal shield, is considered a weapon with the light property for effects such as the two- weapon fighting rules, and can store a lit bullseye lantern, which you wield while holding this shield. If you are disarmed of this shield or doff it, the lantern moves with it. Alantern can be added or removed from the shield as an action.

***Net.*** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or are Huge or larger. A creature can free itself or others by using its action and succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, and destroys the net.

***Pavise.*** A pavise is a tall, oblong shield used to provide portable cover. You can use your action
to plant a pavise in the ground, doffing it as part of the same action. In this state it is no longer wielded, and stands on its own to act as 1/2 cover for an upright creature, or total cover for a prone one.

***Silver Bullet.*** This bullet deals no special damage against most creatures, but any attack with a silver bullet that hits a creature with a special vulnerability to silver, like some fiends or shapechangers, is an automatic critical hit.

***Staff Sling.*** The shaft that adds leverage to the projectiles this sling throws can also be used for close-range combat. This weapon can make be wielded in melee combat as a quarterstaff. In addition, this weapon can be used to throw bombs to any point within its long range.
Tower Shield. While wielding a tower shield, you can use your reaction to gain three-quarters cover against harmful area-of-effects such as breath weapons or spells when targeted or affected by such effects, unless the effect travels around corners.

***Unarmed Strike.*** An attack with any part of your body, such asa fist, elbow, knee, claw, or horn, is an unarmed strike. An unarmed strike is considered a melee weapon for features that activate after a successful weapon attack, such as martial manoeuvres, [[Paladin#Divine Smite|Divine Smite]], or spells delivered with weapons, but is not considered a weapon when an effect or ability such as Two-Weapon Fighting or a Mage Knight's spellcasting focus requires you to wield a weapon.
Racial and class features might provide larger damage dice to unarmed strikes you make with a particular part of your body. In that case, you are proficient in unarmed strikes using only that part, and are not proficient with unarmed strikes using other body parts unless you have them from another source, such as proficiency with martial weapons.
Certain natural weapons granted by racial features often have weapon properties. For example, hooves could have finisher property; teeth and claws could have the ensnaring, slicing, or [[Weapons Remastered#Skewering|skewering]] properties, depending on the shape of your teeth; horns could have [[Weapons Remastered#Skewering|skewering]] or [[Weapons Remastered#Staggering|staggering]]; tails could have [[Weapons Remastered#Staggering|staggering]] property, and so on. Rather than create an exhaustive list here, work with your DM to choose a single property that best fits your race's natural weapons. For balance purposes, no natural weapon weapon should have more than one property.

***Whistling Arrow.*** The bulb carved from wood or antler behind the point of this arrow creates a loud whistle as it flies through the air, that creatures within 300 feet of the path the arrow travels from the archer to its target can clearly hear.

The Armor Table shows the cost, weight, armor class, and properties each type of armor. Class proficiencies and stealth rules remain unchanged, as do the rules for donning and doffing armor. However, armor weighs half as much while you wear it for the purposes of determining encumbrance or carried weight.
When worn, half-plate and heavy armor provide **Damage Reduction**. When you take nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, the damage you take is reduced by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. Full plate reduces the damage by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus instead. This reduction applies before you apply resistances or vulnerabilities.
Any attack that is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage ignores this damage reduction as well, unless the armor you wear is also magical. Certain natural armor, such as that of a tortle or warforged, can also provide damage reduction at the discretion of the DM.
